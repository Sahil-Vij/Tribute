          <br /><br />
          <p>
            The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict was fought between
            India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of
            Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LoC). In
            India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay, which
            was the codename of the Indian military operation in the region.The
            role of the Indian Air Force in acting jointly with the Indian Army
            was aimed at flushing out both the Pakistan Army and paramilitary
            troops from vacated Indian positions along the LoC, in what was
            designated as Operation Safed Sagar.<br />
            <br />
            The conflict >was triggered by the infiltration of Pakistani
            troops—disguised as Kashmiri militants—into strategic positions on
            the Indian side of the LoC, which serves as the de facto border
            between the two countries in the disputed region of Kashmir. During
            its initial stages, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on
            independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by
            casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and
            Chief of Army Staff showed the involvement of Pakistani paramilitary
            forces,led by General Ashraf Rashid.The Indian Army, later supported
            by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on
            the Indian side of the LoC; facing international diplomatic
            opposition, Pakistani forces withdrew from all remaining Indian
            positions along the LoC. <br />

          <h1 id="heading">Recapture of Tiger Hill</h1>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            The Battle of Tiger Hill is one of the bravest battles fought around
            the peak of Tiger Hill by the Indian Army against Pakistan from May
            to July in 1999, during the Kargil War. Recapturing Tiger Hill was
            one of the important victories in the entire “Operation Vijay”
            campaign. The Indian Army had realised that the capture of Tiger
            Hill would provide a major psychological boost to Indian operations
            and hurt the morale of Pakistani troops.<br />
            <br />
            On July 6, the final attack to capture Tiger Hill was launched in
            the dark. First, 18 Grenadiers sub-divided themselves into Alpha,
            Charlie and Ghatak companies. Then, 8 Sikhs began their attack from
            the northern and southern end to divert the enemy’s attention.
            Meanwhile, Ghatak Platoon of 18 Grenadiers silently climbed a steep
            cliff of over 10,000 feet to reach the top.<br /><br />

            The Indian Army surprised the Pakistan soldiers sitting warmly
            inside their bunkers, who were not at all expecting Indian soldiers
            to climb the steep rocky mountains. The Pakistani soldiers panicked
            and began indiscriminate firing, causing severe casualties. Finally,
            Indian Soldiers managed to regain control of Tiger Hill. The Tiger
            Hill was declared to be reclaimed on the morning of July 8 as the
            tricolour was unfurled at the top of the hill.<br /><br />

            After a difficult operation, which lasted for nearly three months,
            the Indian Army re-captured Tiger Hill. In all, 38 Indian troops
            martyred, while 92 Pakistani troops were killed in action. <br />

          <h1 id="heading">Captain Vikram Batra</h1>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            He was born on 9 September, 1974, in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh to
            Girdhari Lal Batra (father) and Kamal Kanta (mother). His mother was
            a school teacher and his father was a government school principal.
            <br /><br />

            He joined IMA in the Manekshaw Battalion in June 1996. He graduated
            from IMA on 6 December, 1997 after completing his 19-month training.
            He was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the 13th Battalion, Jammu
            and Kashmir Rifles. <br /><br />
            After a few training and completing several courses his Battalion,
            13 JAK RIF, received an order to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar
            Pradesh. On 5 June the orders of the battalion were changed and were
            ordered to move to Dras, Jammu, and Kashmir. He is known as the Hero
            of the Kargil War and was instrumental in recapturing Peak 5140 and
            overlooks the Tololing nullah. During the mission, he chose 'Yeh Dil
            Mange More!' as their success signal. <br /><br />

            After capturing Peak 5140, he went for another mission to capture
            Peak 4875. No doubt it was one of the most difficult missions the
            Indian army attempted. In the battle, one of his fellow men had been
            shot. Then, to save him, he took the head and was killed while
            clearing enemy positions. He was awarded Param Vir Chakra,
            posthumously, India's highest and most prestigious award for his
            martyrdom during the Kargil War in 1999 that took place between
            India and Pakistan. <br />

          <h1 id="heading">Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey</h1>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            He was born on 25 June 1975 at Rudha village, Sitapur, Uttar
            Pradesh, India to Shri Gopi Chand Pandey (Father) and Mohini Pandey
            (Mother). He was a soldier of 1/11 Gorkha Rifles. According to his
            father, he had joined the Indian Army with the sole aim of getting a
            Param Vir Chakra, the highest gallantry award. He was awarded the
            Param Vir Chakra posthumously.
            <br /><br />

            Another brave soldier had sacrificed his life for the country's
            pride. His team was tasked to clear the enemy troops, he carried out
            a series of attacks to push back the intruders. Under intense enemy
            fire, the brave and grievously injured officer continued to assault
            that ultimately led to the capture of Jaubar Top and Khalubar hill
            in the Batalik sector.
            <br /><br />
            During his Service Selection Board (SSB) interview, he was
            questioned why he wanted to join the Army? He answered, "I want to
            win the Param Vir Chakra". And for his extreme courage and
            leadership, he was awarded Param Vir Chakra Posthumously.<br />
